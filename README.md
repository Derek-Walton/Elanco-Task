# Elanco Interview Task

## Summary

This interview task consisted of pulling / displaying data from the (Countries Now API)[https://countriesnow.space/].

## Scenario

Elanco's stakeholders want a web application that retrieves country and population data
from a REST API. You will need to consume the data and display this information on a
frontend. The stakeholders want an easy way to visualise how many people live in each
country.

### Suggestions for improvements/enhancements

- Segmenting my code for easier de-bugging, maintainability and readability
- Adding more useful country data, e.g. a button to click for a modal that displayed city info (city population etc), capital population
- Creating a filtering system to filter by population, alphabetical (current default), capital city etc
- Having a more efficient api request, (e.g. 1 request per country max)
- (Out of my current scope) - Implement local storage so save on excessive api calls
- More time towards styling
- Implementing a graph in some sort, e.g. countries and their populations -> cities and their populations
